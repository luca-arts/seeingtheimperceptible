### Research questions

1. To what extent can we use open source machine learning models to remove repetitive and labor intensive work from a photographer?
2. To what extent does the workfield think or hope that AI/ML would change their future craft?
3. How is it possible to combine open source machine learning models within the current workflow of photographers?


4. Additionally: Can AI be of value as a creative stimuli in the creation of a notebook?

## folder structure

In notebooks, per topic there's a directory with notebooks to evaluate different approaches. In the accompanying markdown file we note down the expected result and findings.
