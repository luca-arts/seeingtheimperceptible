# Synthetic Pose Image Generation

## Context

## overview of libraries

1. [Pose Guided Person Image Generation](https://github.com/charliememory/Pose-Guided-Person-Image-Generation)
2. [Guided Image-to-Image Translation with Bi-Directional Feature Transformation](https://github.com/vt-vl-lab/Guided-pix2pix)
3. 3. [EfficientPose](https://github.com/daniegr/EfficientPose)

## testing a library

we'll first evaluate a library before appending it to the topic_template.ipynb file.

This way we want to keep a clean overview of already tested notebooks. If a notebook is still in <tests> then it's not working yet or we think we can iterate/improve on it.

First go to create a new [colab](https://colab.research.google.com) notebook. Then save the notebook in the luca-arts/seeingtheimperceptible repository (with the option to generate a link).
