## Context
[Stable Diffusion Infinity]

## overview of libraries
1. [Stable Diffusion Infinity](https://github.com/lkwq007/stablediffusion-infinity)

## testing a library

we'll first evaluate a library before appending it to the topic_template.ipynb file.

This way we want to keep a clean overview of already tested notebooks. If a notebook is still in <tests> then it's not working yet or we think we can iterate/improve on it.

First go to create a new [colab](https://colab.research.google.com) notebook. Then save the notebook in the luca-arts/seeingtheimperceptible repository (with the option to generate a link).
