        "# Welcome to Prompt Parrot! 🦜\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook is designed to train language model on a list of your prompts,generate prompts in your style, and synthesize wonderful surreal images! ✨ \n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook is created and maintained by [Stephen Young](https://twitter.com/KyrickYoung) or SteveTheNinja#0616 on discord\n",
        "\n",
        "# Models Used\n",
        "- Prompt Parrot is primarily powered by `distilgpt2`, which is a finetuned [GPT-2 model by huggingface](https://huggingface.co/distilgpt2). \n",
        "- And [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion) for image generation a diffusion made by CompVis in colaboration with Stability AI.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Changelog\n",
        "\n",
        "###1.3\n",
        "- Fixed issue where fewer than ~15 prompts would fail. \n",
        "- Implemented start token idea from [multimodalart](https://twitter.com/multimodalart)! Selected `Random` mode during generation to use\n",
        "- Added drive integration and save/load model from drive!\n",
        "\n",
        "###2.0\n",
        "- Streamlined model training UX!\n",
        "- Added ability to save multiple finetuned models! \n",
        "- Gave the parrot a paintbrush! Prompt Parrot will now generate images with Stable Diffusion!\n",
        "- Added image grid options\n",
        "- Provided a list of default prompts! Prompt Parrot now works out of the box! \n",
        "- Added NSFW retry setting. The parrot will try another seed until finally giving up in shame that it can't generate a SFW image.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Instructions\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook has two primary finetuning modes:\n",
        "1. Train on built in prompts\n",
        "1. Train on a prompt file.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Option 1) Builtin Prompts\n",
        "\n",
        "Run all cells! Default settings will use the builtin prompts by default, train GP2 and produce art!\n",
        "\n",
        "### Option 2) Prompt File\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Create a text file with all of your prompts!\n",
        "\n",
        "    **Prompt Parrot requires a minimum of 30 prompts to train effectively.** Less will work, but the results will tend to overfit. More than 50 prompts is ideal! The more the merrier. Try to get as many prompts as you can into the text file!\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example prompt file:\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    a beautiful painting of a mountain by Tyler Edlin, trending on arstation\n",
        "    a stunning painting of Chicago, oil and canvas\n",
        "    cyberpunk hoover dam, cgsociety, artstation, highly detailed matte painting\n",
        "    ```\n",
