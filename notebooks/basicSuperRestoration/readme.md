# TOPIC

## Context

1. [Basic Super Restoration](https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR-examples)

## overview of libraries

1. [BasicSR](https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR)


## testing a library

we'll first evaluate a library before appending it to the topic_template.ipynb file.

This way we want to keep a clean overview of already tested notebooks. If a notebook is still in <tests> then it's not working yet or we think we can iterate/improve on it.

First go to create a new [colab](https://colab.research.google.com) notebook. Then save the notebook in the luca-arts/seeingtheimperceptible repository (with the option to generate a link).
